# Lazy-Beast

# Introduction

The project of the name is 'Lazy Beast' which explains pretty
much everything from its name that it is the software which is
designed for lazy users who don’t want to remember the
commands of the CMD (Command Prompt) and can still do
pretty much fire up the commands just by passing few shortcuts
for the commands.

# Origin of the idea

There exist such script for the Linux environment called 'Lazy
Script' which is developed for performing penetration testing
and hacking in an easier way. But it is strictly platform dependent [Linux]
The GitHub link for this project is as below :- https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript
Hence if you want to try something like it for Windows then
you can try my project.

# Why should anyone care about it ?

This is totally modifiable terminal which can pretty much
perform any of the system operation you want hence we can
make use it for some of specific purpose when we have restrict
want some of the restriction on some of the commands and
hence we can do the same and use it for the specific purpose
only. Secondly as there are many of the shortcuts hence any of the
normal user can just fire up the command like a piece of a
cake without remembering any of it.

# Future enhancements

I made this project just for the CMD (Command Prompt). But it could be also developed for the Powershell , Linux
terminal or for Termux (android mobile Linux terminal). And also the addition of the features in it is always
limitless. Hence there can always be scope ofimprovement in it.
